Nincraft Launcher
================

Nincraft Launcher is a Minecraft launcher based off the SKCraft Launcher. We have several custom modpacks and one main server that is updated often with the latest mods.

### History

The launcher has been in development since the early days of Minecraft Alpha. It has powered and always has powered sk89q's own server, SKCraft.

[The older 3.x version was can be found elsewhere](https://github.com/sk89q/SKMCLauncher).
